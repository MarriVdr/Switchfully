        <h1>Interneting Is Easy</h1>
        <p>First, we need to learn some basic HTML.</p> 

        <h2>Headings</h2>
        <p>Headings define the outline of your site. There are 6 levels.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list)</li>
        <li>Add each item in its own "li" element.</li>
        <li>They don't need to be in any particular order.</li>
        <li>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list)</li>
    </ol>

    <ul>
        <li>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list)</li>
        <li>Add each item in its own "li" element.</li>
        <li>They don't need to be in any particular order.</li>
        <li><p>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Inline Elements aka emphasis</h3>
    <p><em>Sometimes</em>, you need to draw attention to a particular word or phrase.
    Or you need to <strong>strongly</strong> emphasize the importance of a word or phrase.</p>
    <p><em><strong>And sometimes you need to shout!!</strong></em></p>
